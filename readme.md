# Passport Interview - Colin Campbell

## State Management in React
- *Why This Repo?*
  - Alex asked me how I manage state in my React apps and I wasn't sure how to answer
  - This repo is how I manage state without any major dependencies
- *App Description*
  - A naive tick tack toe game with the following useless features
    - The board's color changes from red to green depending on whether the price of bitcoin has recently increased or decreased
    - You can try to taunt the other player, but you'll be placed in timeout, meaning you must wait 10 seconds to make your move
- *Installation*
  - Clone the repo, 'yarn install', and run on localhost:3000 with 'yarn start'
- *Implementation Notes* 
  - Not meant to demonstrate my UI skills, only how I manage state
  - Heavily stripped down create-react-app
  - Using a dependency resolution for the mini-css-extract-plugin due to the following [package issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11930)
- *How Is State Managed?*
  - The hook defined in src/runtime/index.js combines a set of runtime hooks (src/runtime/*.js) into a single output. Some utility functions inside of src/lib.js are used to track and update changes to this output. Any component can subscribe to its changes via useRuntime().
- *Files relating to state management*
  - *src/lib.js*
    - Defines some functions that make it possible to track and share state across react components.
  - *src/index.js*
    - Sets up our demo app
  - *src/runtime/index.js*
    - Combines runtime hook outputs into a single hook for consumption in src/index.js
- *Benefits of This Pattern*
  - Encourages housing all application behavior within a set of centrally accessible hooks
  - Avoids large dependencies
  - Adding and removing features is straightforward since all runtime hooks are loosely coupled and can communicate bi-directionally via simple pub/sub mechanism (though use with caution)
  - Fixes prop drilling
  - Easy to setup use with TypeScript
- *When Would I Use This?*
  - I would NOT use this with a large team and would never push it on any teammates in a larger company. This is a pattern that works when all developers are aware of it's quirks. Would struggle to scale without some extra linting help or typescript.
  - As a solo developer I would 100% use this to build a small product or tool
